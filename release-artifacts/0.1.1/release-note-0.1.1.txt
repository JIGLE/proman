### How to release ✅

Releases are created from the `publish-ghcr.yml` workflow. The recommended and safest method is to publish by creating an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`. You can also run the workflow manually (via **Actions → Build and publish to GHCR → Run workflow**) and use the `dry_run` and `version` inputs for testing and overrides.
