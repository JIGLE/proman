Archived workflows

These were moved from `.github/workflows/archived/` into this directory to avoid accidental execution. They are kept for historical/reference purposes.

If you want to re-enable any of them, copy the file back into `.github/workflows/`, pin any actions as required, and open a PR with tests and a dry-run verification.
