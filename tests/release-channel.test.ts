/**
 * Only a tag push may claim `:latest` or a bare version number.
 *
 * This rule is not theoretical. `deploy-ghcr.yml` records the incident that produced it:
 * `ghcr.io/jigle/situs:1.24.0` was once built from commit `43997fd` while the git tag `v1.24.0`
 * pointed somewhere else, and `:latest` moved onto unreleased code at the same time. A version
 * number that does not mean the source it was cut from is worse than no version number, because
 * it is trusted.
 *
 * Adding the `main` development channel is exactly the change that could bring that back — one
 * stray `,:latest` in the wrong branch and every production pull silently follows an untested
 * merge. So this runs the workflow's ACTUAL tag-decision script under each ref and asserts what
 * comes out, rather than grepping the file for a string. A text match would pass on a script that
 * had been restructured into being wrong.

/**
 * A version token safe to paste into a shell script.
 *
 * This value is substituted into bash source that is then executed, so it is an injection
 * surface. It was previously escaped with `.replace(/"/g, '\\"')`, which escapes the quote but
 * not the backslash — so a value ending in `\` escapes its own escape and the quote breaks out
 * anyway. CodeQL flags that as `js/incomplete-sanitization`, and it is right to.
 *
 * Escaping this correctly is fiddly and easy to get wrong a second time. Every caller passes a
 * version string, so require one and drop the escaping entirely: rejecting the bad input is a
 * stronger guarantee than sanitizing it.
